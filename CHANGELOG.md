# Changelog

Every user-visible correction receives an application version and a dated entry in this file. Application versions follow Semantic Versioning pre-release notation. The `.h3director.json` project-format version is maintained separately and changes only when the saved schema changes.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Added the machine-readable `VERSION` file and shared `version_info.py` loader.
- Displayed the application version in the main Studio title and Qt application metadata.
- Saved `application_version` beside the independent project-format `version` in every Director Project JSON.
- Added repository-wide line-ending and binary-file rules through `.gitattributes`.
- Documented versioning, runtime downloads, Timeline Prompt Reconcile, semantic Shot adaptation and the current 156-test baseline.

### Fixed

- Corrected a broken Design system-prompt sentence that previously produced `When a Treat each asset...` and weakened Media Pool reuse instructions.
- Updated public README examples to avoid development-machine LAN addresses and accurately describe the Z-Image workflow without RTX upscaling.

### Verification

- `156` automated tests passed with the bundled Python environment.

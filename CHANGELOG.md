# Changelog

Every user-visible correction receives an application version and a dated entry in this file. Application versions follow Semantic Versioning pre-release notation. The `.h3director.json` project-format version is maintained separately and changes only when the saved schema changes.

## [0.1.0-alpha.9] - 2026-08-26

### Verified

- Added an explicit end-to-end reference-mapping matrix for a single native 1.00-15.00s render, a 14.00-20.00s partial render crossing a reference boundary, and a hidden two-window 1.00-30.00s Smart Render.
- Verified that the second long-form window reserves `<Video 1>` for exactly 24 preceding motion frames while active Timeline video references and synchronized/standalone audio references retain their correct effective ordinals.
- Verified local edits independently in the first, middle and final Segment, plus an authored 30-second Timeline split into three ten-second Shot render units; only the edited unit's content fingerprint changes.
- Verified delete/re-add, movement from an old Segment into a new Segment, movement between compatible visible Tracks, and Track visibility filtering without changing the permanent Media Pool identity.
- Verified two non-contiguous uses of the same physical Media Pool source on one Track (1.00-4.00s and 25.00-30.00s): each window receives one correct H3 connection and its own Clip Prompt, without duplicate loader execution or ordinal drift.
- Re-ran project-format-15 save/restore, mixed Picture/Video/Audio compilation, collision-safe ComfyUI uploads, local cache reuse, 24-frame continuity generation and final Smart Render assembly as part of the complete suite.

### Verification

- `192` automated tests passed with the bundled Python environment.
- The Director Project format remains version `15`; no saved-project migration is required.

## [0.1.0-alpha.8] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Re-audited the complete workflow from API discovery and Media Pool assignment through AI Design, Timeline Prompt Reconcile, native/Smart Render compilation, ComfyUI upload, segment assembly, generated MP4 archiving and Director Project restore.
- Applied Visual Track visibility and Audio Track Mute/Solo/enable state before compiling both the Prompt ordinals and H3 input connections for native renders and Active API exports; the two sides can no longer disagree after a track is disabled.
- Recompiled every native render directly from the filtered Timeline state so a stale visible Prompt cannot leak an earlier reference map into the queued workflow.
- Converted partial native work areas to segment-local Shot timestamps, preventing a 15.00-23.00s Timeline repair from sending global 16.00-22.00s timestamps into an eight-second H3 request.
- Assigned a deterministic collision-safe ComfyUI upload name to every physical image/video/audio loader and patched each compiled workflow accordingly. Different local files with the same basename can no longer overwrite or impersonate one another during `overwrite=true` uploads.
- Added structured upload manifests to both native and Smart Render workers while retaining backward compatibility with legacy string-only jobs.

### Verification

- Added an end-to-end 30-second Smart Render simulation that validates Segment Prompt tags, active H3 connections, 24-frame continuity Video numbering, paired Video Audio numbering, standalone Audio offset and loader upload names together.
- Added native hidden/Mute mapping, partial-work-area local-time and duplicate-basename upload regression tests.
- `182` automated tests passed with the bundled Python environment.

## [0.1.0-alpha.7] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Completed a repository-wide Python mapping audit covering Picture, Video and Audio references across Media Pool, repeated Timeline Clip Instances, AI Design, Timeline Prompt Reconcile, classic H3 Studio, native generation, Smart Render and Active API export.
- Canonicalized internally generated bare media mentions such as `P3`, `V2` and `A1` into stable `@P3`, `@V2` and `@A1` references before per-Segment compilation, without rewriting literal product/model names globally.
- Prevented classic H3 Studio AI output and Director Active API exports from reusing a prompt compiled for a different work-area reference map.
- Deduplicated repeated Timeline instances by their physical source node and binding even when an editor instance carries its own node ID.
- Made enabled soundtracks from reference videos explicit in `subject_definitions` and `retention_policy`, and correctly offset standalone `<Audio N>` ordinals behind those synchronized video-audio signals.
- Removed request-local H3 angle-bracket tags from the AI Design Media Pool inventory so Design can author only permanent Media Pool IDs.

### Verification

- All `36` project Python files were statically inspected for reference-number construction, prompt compilation and workflow-binding paths.
- `178` automated tests passed with the bundled Python environment, including a mixed P4/P7/V2/A3 Segment test and inactive-reference anti-alias checks.

## [0.1.0-alpha.6] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Separated permanent Studio media IDs (`@P4`, `@V2`, `@A1`) from MiniMax H3's request-local `<Picture N>`, `<Video N>` and `<Audio N>` ordinals.
- Remapped authored stable IDs and legacy angle-bracket references only when compiling each active render Segment, including Shot fields, Creative Brief, transition/marker instructions and Clip Prompts.
- Prevented inactive or unavailable legacy references from silently aliasing another connected asset after H3 renumbering; they now compile to an explicit non-reference diagnostic instead.
- Kept AI Semantic Enrichment fingerprints attached to the physical Media Pool source when that source receives a different effective ordinal or is used through a repeated Timeline Clip Instance.
- Updated the Director Cut and classic H3 Studio UI shortcuts to derive numbering from permanent physical bindings rather than mutable prompt tags.

### Changed

- AI Design now writes stable `@P/@V/@A` references in authored JSON and reserves angle-bracket H3 tags for the final per-Segment compiler.

### Verification

- `172` automated tests passed with the bundled Python environment.

## [0.1.0-alpha.5] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Added independent Timeline Clip Instances so one Media Pool source can be reused in any number of non-contiguous ranges, tracks or overlapping layers.
- Added per-instance timing, activation, source trim, playback speed, fades, transitions, monitor visibility and Clip Prompt persistence with Undo/Redo.
- Allowed AI Design JSON to route the same `P`/`V`/`A` Media Pool ID into multiple time-scoped `existing_media_uses` rows.

### Changed

- Kept recognition and AI Semantic Enrichment source-owned and automatically shared across all repeated instances.
- Deduplicated repeated instances when assigning effective MiniMax H3 reference ordinals, uploading media and compiling subject definitions, while retaining every time range and per-instance direction in the generated prompt.
- Updated Program Monitor video/audio player keys and Smart Render fingerprints so repeated clips remain independently seekable and locally editable.
- Raised the Director Project format to version `15`; version 14 and older projects continue loading with their original media placements as first-use clips.

### Verification

- `168` automated tests passed with the bundled Python environment.

## [0.1.0-alpha.4] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Resynchronized the Track Header vertical offset after project loading, dynamic V-track creation and header rebuilding. Picture clips with valid V-track IDs can no longer appear visually aligned with A1/A2/A3 labels because the two panes retained different scroll positions.

### Verification

- `162` automated tests passed with the bundled Python environment.

## [0.1.0-alpha.3] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- Gave the Timeline Tools palette a DPI-aware minimum width based on its longest button and scrollbar, so every icon keeps its visible Selection/Hand/Razor/Shot/Type/Prompt/Transition/Marker label even when the splitter is dragged left.

### Verification

- `161` automated tests passed with the bundled Python environment.

## [0.1.0-alpha.2] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Allowed AI Design plans to create and populate editorial tracks beyond V3/A3 (up to V16/A16), including separate visual title and dialogue/voice-over/lyrics lanes.
- Added automatic cross-segment motion context using exactly the preceding 24 frames at 24 fps, without carrying prior audio.
- Added strict single-colour, edge-connected background detection and non-destructive transparent PNG derivatives for Media Pool and Design-generated images.

### Changed

- Reserved one of the three physical H3 video reference inputs for hidden continuity when possible; if all are occupied, the least-specific Auto reference is released for that segment while force-active references remain untouched.
- Raised the Smart Render policy version to `6`, invalidating older segment manifests whose continuity assumptions are no longer safe to reuse.

### Verification

- `161` automated tests passed with the bundled Python environment.

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Added the machine-readable `VERSION` file and shared `version_info.py` loader.
- Displayed the application version in the main Studio title and Qt application metadata.
- Saved `application_version` beside the independent project-format `version` in every Director Project JSON.
- Added repository-wide line-ending and binary-file rules through `.gitattributes`.
- Documented versioning, runtime downloads, Timeline Prompt Reconcile, semantic Shot adaptation and the current 156-test baseline.

### Fixed

- Corrected a broken Design system-prompt sentence that previously produced `When a Treat each asset...` and weakened Media Pool reuse instructions.
- Updated public README examples to avoid development-machine LAN addresses and accurately describe the Z-Image workflow without RTX upscaling.

### Verification

- `156` automated tests passed with the bundled Python environment.
